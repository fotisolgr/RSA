# RSA implementation using GMP library
***
## Information about the implementation:

To implement the **RSA** algorithm and in order to manage large numbers, we have to install **GMP** library 
following the instructions in [this](https://gmplib.org/) website. The implementation of **RSA** encryption 
was done in **C** language.

## Compilation command:
``` gcc rsa.c -o rsa -lgmp ```
***
## Execution command:
